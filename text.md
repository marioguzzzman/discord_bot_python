user: Hi! 
RG: Hello there! 

user: why is your name RG? what does RG mean
RG: RG is coming from RGB. As I'm yellow, my Red and Green values are high, but I don't contain any Blue. 

user: sol lewitt, video
RG: Oh, Sol LeWitt! Wait... there is this video, which I find very inspiring... It's a letter by Sol LeWitt to Eva Hesse read live by Andrew Scott. Ah, here: https://www.nowness.com/series/letters-live/andrew-scott-sol-lewitt-eva-hesse
I hope you will like it too! 

user: open ended instructions, yoko ono, clouds dripping
RG: Open ended instructions? I love them. Have you tried generating images from text already with an AI already? There are many platforms, DALL-E, Midjourney, the easiest to use for me was DALL-E mini: https://huggingface.co/spaces/dalle-mini/dalle-mini
Or just have a chat with Chat GPT, and ask it to give you a poem... or anything... I'm a bit jealous to be honest :S 

user: yoko ono book
RG: Here is a link to the book: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grapefruit_(book) 

user: other programming languages
RG: Other programming languages? Yeah, that's a tough one, it is hard to choose. I liked this article by Tim Rodenbröker, he has great tutorials by the way: https://timrodenbroeker.de/processing-or-p5/
But if you are interested in artistic and fun programming languages (yes, it is a thing!), take a look here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language

RG: https://p5js.org/learn/debugging.html

RG: Yes, asking for help can sometimes be tricky! I found this link useful, it helps to understand hackers and coders more: http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html 

user: RGB , visualization , color
RG: Rita usually uses Photoshop to find the values of exact colors, but this website is also very useful: https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_rgb.asp
And here is a tutorial written by Daniel Shiffman about colors. https://processing.org/tutorials/color 

user: noise , perlin
RG: Daniel Shiffman is the best! These are the tutotirals I recommend about noise by him. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qf4dIN99e2w and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcdldZ1E9gU

user: 10print
RG: 10 PRINT CHR$(205.5+RND(1)); : GOTO 10 - What a classic! Here is the book about it, I hope you will also find it interesting! https://10print.org/10_PRINT_121114.pdf 

user: Vera Molnár random
RG: Vera Molnár! So wonderful! She said randomness enriches the senses. I recommend this video to learn about how she uses randomness in her art: https://vimeo.com/372579247

RG: Does this look familiar? https://www.oniris.art/en/artists/32-vera-molnar/works/5761-vera-molnar-25-carres-ref.-f-1989/  She has more artwork with a similar logic behind! Why don't you research yourself a bit on this topic?
